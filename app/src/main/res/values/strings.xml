        \n\u3000\u3000 Universal Memorizing Assistant is an app that you can use it in many conditions concerning memorizing,
        like learning a second language, memorizing answers to questions and so on. \n\n\u3000\u3000
        Here is some of its usage:\n\n
        \u3000\u3000 - Memorizing words that are not likely to find in a dictionary:\n

        \n\u3000\u3000 The biggest difference between this app and other word/sentence-memorizing app is that
        in this app you will custom your memorizing content completely.\n\n

        \n\u3000\u3000 This app use the .xls file as a storage to store your data to memorize (sorry that .xlsx is not supported yet),
        each file is called a \'book\' in this app, represent a book you will memorize.\n
        \n\u3000\u3000 You can edit your .xls file in your PC and use it in your phone, through this app,
        which I think is the most convenient way to make your own book and use it:\n

    <string name="manual_text_10">
        \n\u3000\u3000 A folder named U_Memorizing will be created in your phone storage in the root dictionary, and all
the .xls files in this folder will be scanned as books to use. So when you have created a book file
in your PC and want to use it in this app, move it into this folder. And if you want to backup your
books, back up this folder.\n
